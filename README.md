# Whisky-Drop

A basic landing page for an imaginary e-commerce service that sells and variety of whiskeys.

The page includes a navigation bar, three separate sections that include several different contents, and a pop-up window that appears when the user clicks on the sign-up buttons just to name the basics.

The website is also mobile-first responsive to allow for a larger number of people to visit the site from a variety of devices, and therefore a create more sales.

## Deployment

The project was developed in its entirety using GitPod and hosted on GitHub pages. The live site can be found here (https://gerakas.github.io/Whiskey-Drop/).

## Purpose

This project was created simply to allow me to learn and grasp the main principles and core progressive pipeline behind designing a basic landing page for an e-commerce website. 

## Credit

This project would not have been possible without the remarkably insightful video tutorials and written material provided by the [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/5-day-coding-challenge/?utm_term=code%20institute&utm_campaign=a%2526c_BR_IRL_Code_Institute&utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=ppc&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_tgt=kwd-319867646331&hsa_ad=417883010337&hsa_acc=8983321581&hsa_grp=62188641240&hsa_mt=e&hsa_cam=1578649861&hsa_kw=code%20institute&hsa_ver=3&hsa_src=g&gclid=CjwKCAjwiMj2BRBFEiwAYfTbCsXmupOD9J4_lSbHE2oiH-pK-3sy8mRhx6xyf7Mw2VgqYFez5-PgMRoCD_wQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds), and it's great community of people and mentors on Slack.

I would also like to say a big thanks to the developers of [Bootstap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?sidebar.open&selection.family=Roboto:wght@300;700) and [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/), for allowing all types of developers around the world (including amateurs like myself) to make use of their libraries of code, fonts and icons for free. Which have, in turn, played a big role in the creation of this and many other projects to come.
